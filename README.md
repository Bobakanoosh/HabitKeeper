# Habit Keeper

Habit Keeper is a chrome extension that allows you to interactively work towards a goal of yours. Each day you work towards your habit, you progress the day counter by one. Be careful though, if you don't keep your habit for 48 hours, you'll lose all the days you've racked up!

Habit Keeper is highly customizable, allowing you to change nearly every visual aspect of the extension to fit your aesthetic needs.
## Getting Started

1. Head over to the extension's home on the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/habit-keeper/djmemjiaekoigemohhoofehlennhcaff?hl=en), and add it to your browser. 
2. Then, open a new tab, and hit `esc` to customize.
3. Once done customizing, toggle the options menu, complete your habit for the day, and then hold click anywhere on the screen and wait for the progress circle to fill up.
4. Voila! You're on your way to keeping a good habit!
